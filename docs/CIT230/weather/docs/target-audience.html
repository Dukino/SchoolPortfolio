        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
            The target audience for this website is for any user that is interested in
            checking the weather on a quick and easy format. The website is suitable for
            users who have mobile devices as well as those who are more suited to using
            a larger device like a laptop or tablet.
        </p>
        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <h3>Gerald Lawson</h3>
        <p>
            Gerald is a senior citizen with grandchildren who he visits and travels with 
            often. He suffers from a type of arthritis that makes it difficult to be out
            in cold or wet weather. He likes to take his grandchildren to the park and
            needs to be able to know if his joints can handle it that day.
        </p>
        <h3>Nicole Jackson</h3>
        <p>
            Nicole is a senior in college studying Communications. She drives to class and
            work but likes to plan her outfits in advance to make her the most comfortable
            when she has to walk from class to class. Her outfit needs to be work appropriate 
            for her job but also warm and comfortable enough to be worn in the cold Idaho 
            winter.
        </p>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <h3>Scenario 1 - Gerald</h3>
        <p>
            Gerald is wanting to take his grandkids to the park on Saturday. It has been 
            raining for the last few days and he wants to know if it will clear up by 
            Saturday. He boots up his old computer and goes to RainOrShineNow.com. He 
            sees immediately that the weather on Saturday will be cloudy so he writes 
            himself a note to make sure his grandkids have a jacket when they leave the 
            house. 
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario 2 - Gerald</h3>
        <p>
            Gerald's daughter calls one afternoon to say her son has a soccer game near
            Gerald's house tonight. She wants to know if he will be able to make it or not. 
            Gerald says he will be able to go as long as the weather holds up. He tells her
            that he will call her back and let her know if he won't be able to make it 
            because of the weather. He hangs up and references the RainOrShineNow.com website
            to see what the weather will be like. He sees the weather will be fine for his 
            arthritis and happily gets ready to leave. 
        </p>
        <h3> Scenario 3 - Gerald</h3>
        <p>
            Gerald notices some unexpected clouds rolling in one afternoon. He wants to water
            his flowers that day to keep them healthy but knows that if it rains he won't have
            to. He opens RainOrShineNow.com on his phone to quickly check what the updated 
            weather report is. Turns out there is supposed to be some rain overnight. Gerald
            decides he won't have to water his plants because of the constantly updating
            app and prepares to stay in for the night. 
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario 4 - Nicole</h3>
        <p>
            Nicole wakes up at 8am to get ready for work and her classes for the day. As she 
            looks through her closet, she sees a sweater that she wants to wear. It's starting
            to get warmer outside lately and she worries it will be too hot for the sweater.
            She opens her phone to check RainOrShineNow.com and sees that it will be in the mid-60s
            with a lot of sun that day. She chooses a different shirt instead. 
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario 5 - Nicole</h3>
        <p>
            As Nicole is driving to class, she sees some dark clouds in the distance and a couple
            droplets on her windshield. She parks outside of her first class of the day, opens her
            phone, and checks RainOrShineNow.com. She sees that in two hours it is supposed to rain.
            She grabs the extra coat and umbrella she keeps in her car for her long walk to her next 
            class after this one.
