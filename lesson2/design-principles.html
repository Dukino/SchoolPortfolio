                <p>According to the Law of Proximity, people group items that belong together. In this example, the top
                    and left navigation bars are grouped in their respective areas to show that they are separate from
                    the main content of the page. Also, the main content of the page is grouped into sections that
                    YouTube recommends that you watch. Some are grouped by your recommended videos, categories,
                    trending, and so on.

        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="item1">
                <p>Company: Best Buy</p>
                <a
                    href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/laptop-computers/all-laptops/pcmcat138500050001.c?id=pcmcat138500050001">bestbuy.com</a>
                <p>Bestbuy.com displays a perfect example of Hick's Law and how to combat the issue of too many options.
                    When you start looking for specific items, either by search or by browsing categories, you are
                    presented with options on the left side of the page so you can narrow your search for the item you
                    want. These options vary depending on what category you are currently in and they adapt based on
                    which filters you select as you go.

        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="item1">
                <p>Company: Google</p>
                <a href="https://www.google.com">Google.com</a>
                <p>Google has always had a great design for their home page. It follows the unspoken rule that until the
                    user asks for something, don't show them much. On their mobile site this is a little different with
                    some recommendations that they offer but for the most part the rule still stands. Their use of white
                    space works perfectly to only offer what little they can so the user can easily find what they want.
